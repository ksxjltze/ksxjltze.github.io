Hello there. Welcome to my humble website. <br>
My name is Jia Keat, I'm a Junior at the DigiPen Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation.

I've been building software in C++ for over 5 years, mostly games and game engines for Windows.
I specialize in game engine architecture and serialization, with a bit of graphics programming on the side.

During my time as an undergraduate at DigiPen, other than making games, I've dabbled in web development, cloud computing, mobile app development, parallel programming and more.

I love technology, video games, and building software.
