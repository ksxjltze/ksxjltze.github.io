I'm no artist, but I've dabbled in pixel art and 3D modelling for fun.<br>

<h2>Boi</h2>
<img width="30%" src="/images/boi.png" alt="mushroom"/><br>
My very first work of art. I often use it as placeholder art in my projects.<br>

<h2>Boi 3D</h2>
<img width="100%" src="/images/boi3D.png" alt="3D mushroom"/><br>
An attempt at recreating Boi in 3D using Blender.
