description: Learning how to use Spring boot for backend development.
---

A simple project for learning the Spring Boot framework.
See the tutorial [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/#scratch).

The plan is to use this project to complement another project that I have, [Angularing](/projects/angularing/).
For the time being, this backend will act as simple REST service to serve JSON data while I think about what kind of database architecture I should go with.
