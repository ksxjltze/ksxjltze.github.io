A simple project for learning the Angular framework.
Thanks to Vercel, you can see it in action [here](https://angularing.vercel.app/).

The project name is a work-in-progress, I'll most likely change it after I decide what I actually want to make (after the tutorial).

## Diary?
### Day One
Created a repository from the Vercel Angular quickstart template. Went to sleep.

### Day Two
Did the Hello World on the tutorial and worked on the following lessons every once in a while. Learned about components, templates, routing, HTML interpolation, property binding, input/output pattern, services, etc.

I called it a day after completing lesson 11 (Route parameters).
